These are the coffee codes, namely the post-processing of preliminary research
for the perfect espresso.

To run the codes, one should create folders 'Data' (with .csv data of mass 
and pressure) and 'Plots' (where all the plots will land into).

The draw_plots.py code plots masses and pressure vs time for each data separately.

The collective_plot.pt code plots all the samples together. The code takes 
all the data in the 'Data' catalogue, so the plot might be unreadable for 
too many samples.
